excellent templating engine - special tags 

templates integral part of html - dont have to build separately - easier to use than special mustache js -- 

handles DOM easily 

event triggers --- data is directly bound to your template 

also works with AJAX 

MVC architecture -- 
this approach with angular 

Model - data (come from datastrucrue, db, json )
views - how are displayed - done through template 

controllers - glue that times models and views - 

core features :
directives - place in html starts with ng
data binding --- {{}} tie form elements with data 
filters -- data can be organized in a certain way 

modules --- break up functionality into modules 
routes -- heart of spa -- lets you divide your templates 

controllers 


angular js is lot more than adding basic functionality of html -- so better to put it at the top
